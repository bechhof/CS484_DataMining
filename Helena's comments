Nathaniel, 

Thank you for putting the PowerPoint together. Enclosed are my comments/suggestions for the PowerPoint.
Pease let me know if you have any questions:

Considering this is a presentation to the class, we cannot expect them to read all paragraphs during the presentation. 
That being said, I would recommend to summarize each slide with key points touched on. 
To make our topic even more intriguing we can most certainly add some visuals in replacement of the paragraphs as well.
