  \frametitle{How does education predict income?}
 \begin{block}{Problem}
  We'd like to find out how much we can infer about someone's income from their education, 
  both in the United States and Europe. 
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{block}{Why it matters}
  If income matters for variables of interest from health to happiness, we can make indirect inferences about individuals and groups using individual or average education levels \textit{combined with other information}. 
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{small}
  \begin{block}{Some motivating facts}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2012-economic-commentaries/ec-201210-the-college-wage-premium.aspx}{``College degree holders enjoy an 84 percent increase in earnings over their high-school-educated counterparts [in the United States].''} 
  \item \href{http://inequality.org/oecd-report-inequality-rising-faster/}{In the United States, income earners at the 90th percentile make roughly 16 times as much as those at the 10th percentile.}
  \item \href{http://csweb.brookings.edu/content/research/essays/2014/saving-horatio-alger.html}{Americans born in the bottom income quintile have a 10\% chance of entering the top quintile. That probability \textbf{doubles} with a college degree.}
  \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{small}

\frame % Slide 3 
{
  \frametitle{Data Sources}
  We use two datasets:
  \begin{itemize} 
  \item \href{http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/}{European Social Survey (ESS)} 
  \item \href{https://cps.ipums.org/cps/index.shtml}{United States Current Population Survey (CPS)}
  \end{itemize}
  We obtained data files from the ESS website and the IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series) in \texttt{dta} and \texttt{dat} formats.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Both datasets are from the years 2010, 2012, and 2014.
  \item Both datasets contain rich information about respondents.
  \item We can use the US data from 2011, 2013, and 2015 to test (some of) our predictions.
  \end{itemize}
  The US data has 610,756 observations; the ESS data has 157,261 observations.

  \frametitle{Features}
Our dependent variable is measured differently in these datasets: the ESS gives us within country deciles, while the CPS gives a numerical answer in dollars.

\frame % Slide 5 Architecture
{
  \frametitle{Architecture}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For the ESS, we obtained a \texttt{dta} file with missing values and value labels already applied.
  \item We used the software Stata to apply given data definitions from IPUMS to the CPS \texttt{dat} file to obtain an informative \texttt{dta} file.  
  \item With \texttt{pandas}, a Python package, we read the \texttt{dta} files as \texttt{DataFrame} objects to use in a Python 3.5 ecosystem.
  \item Within this ecosystem, we used the \texttt{matplotlib} and \texttt{seaborn} packages for exploratory visualization.
  \end{itemize}

\frame % Slide 6
{
  \frametitle{Preprocessing}

 For the US, we only analyze those between the ages of 30 and 34 making between \$10K and \$500K. 
 
 We recoded our categorial predictors as dummy variables: 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Whether the person has a college degree (for education).
 \item If the person is female (for gender).
 \item If the person is looking for work or has found work (for labor force status).
 \end{itemize}
 
 Moreover, we use the natural log of income as our outcome variable, rather than income itself. Consequently, the fact that $\ln(1+x) \approx x$ means that differences in outcomes can be interpreted as percentage differences; i.e. predicting an increase of 0.1 in our outcome variable corresponds to an approximately 10\% increase in income.

\frame % Slide 7
{
  \frametitle{Normalization}


\begin{block}{Why use the natural log of income?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The distribution of the natural log of income is closer to a Gaussian. 
  \item Economists typically model earnings as a function of education and work experience using the \emph{Mincer equation}, which assumes complementarity.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

\frame % Slide 8
{
  \frametitle{Feature Selection}
  For both data sets, we have variables telling us the following about respondents:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Educational Attainment
  \item Age
  \item Gender
  \end{itemize}
  
  The Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) data from the CPS (obtained every March) that we are using has rich data about the occupation and employment status of respondents, which can help us clarify how education affects income.
}


\frame % Slide 9 Dimensionality Reduction
{
  \frametitle{Dimensionality Reduction}
  

Some variables we don't use:
\begin{itemize}
\item Whether one is currently in college
\item Birthplace 
\item Poverty 
\item Marital Status
\item Veteran Status
\end{itemize}

  We are currently working on reducing the dimensionality of occupation, to test whether the returns to education vary a lot by occupational choice.
